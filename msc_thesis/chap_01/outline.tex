\section{Outline of the Thesis}
\label{sec:outline}
This thesis consists of five main chapters. 
In Chapter 2, we discuss the theory of Reinforcement Learning and introduce the methods used in this thesis.
In Chapter 3, we explained the theory of Neural Networks and Deep Learning along with architectures which are designed to process sequential data. 
In Chapter 4, Bipedal Walker environments are presented, neural networks and RL algoritmhs are proposed, results are summarized and discussed.
In last Chapter, thesis is concluded by discussing obtained results and possible future works are discussed.
