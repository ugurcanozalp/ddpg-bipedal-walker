Reinforcement Learning methods are used in many mechanical control tasks such as autonomus driving  \cite{pan_virtual_2017} \cite{shalev-shwartz_safe_2016} \cite{sallab_deep_2017} \cite{wang_deep_2019} and autonomus flight   \cite{kopsa_reinforcement_2018} \cite{abbeel_application_2006} \cite{santos_experimental_2012}.

Rastogi \cite{rastogi_deep_2017} used Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to walk their physical bipedal walker robot.

Kumar et al. \cite{kumar_bipedal_2018} also used DDPG to perform robot walking in 2D simulation environment. 

Song et al. \cite{song_recurrent_2018} pointed out the partial observability problem of bipedal walker.
