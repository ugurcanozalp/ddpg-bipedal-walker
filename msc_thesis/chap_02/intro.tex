\chapter{REINFORCEMENT LEARNING}

\label{chap:rl_chap}

Reinforcement Learning one of three main machine learning paradigm along with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

Reinforcement Learning is learning a policy function $\pi \colon S \mapsto A$ which maps inputs (states) $s \in S$ to outputs (actions) $a \in A$. Learning is done by maximizing value function $V^{\pi}(s)$ for all possible states, which depends on policy $\pi$.
