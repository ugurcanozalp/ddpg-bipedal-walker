\chapter{REINFORCEMENT LEARNING}

\label{chap:rl_chap}

Machine Learning is ability of computer program which allows adaptation to new situations through experience, without explicitly programmed \cite{mitchell_machine_1997}.

Reinforcement Learning one of three main machine learning paradigm along with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. It is closest kind of learning demonstrated by humans and animals since it is grounded by biological learning systems \cite{sutton_reinforcement_1998}.

Mathematically, Reinforcement Learning is learning a policy function $\pi \colon S \mapsto A$ which maps inputs (states) $s \in S$ to outputs (actions) $a \in A$. Learning is done by maximizing value function $V^{\pi}(s)$ for all possible states, which depends on policy $\pi$.
