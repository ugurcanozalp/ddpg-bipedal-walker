\section{Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control}
\label{sec:rl_and_control}

Optimal control is a field of mathematical optimization, 
concerned by  finding control policy of a dynamical system (environment) for given objective. 
For example, objective might be total revenue for a company as system, 
minimal fuel burn for a car as system, or total production for a factory. 

RL is kind of naive subfield of Optimal Control. 
However, RL algorithms find policy (controller) by error minimization of objective from experience, 
while Optimal Control methods are concerned exact analytical optimal solutions based on dynamic model of environment and agent. 

Optimal Control methods are efficient and robust when mathematical model of environment is available, 
accurate enough and solvable for optimal controller. 
However, some real world problems usually do not exhibit all of these conditions. 
In such cases, Reinforcement Learning is an easier way to derive a control policy.
