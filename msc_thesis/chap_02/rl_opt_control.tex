\section{Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control}
\label{sec:rl_and_control}

Optimal control is a field of mathematical optimization, to find the control policy of a dynamical system (environment) for a given objective. 
For example, objective might be the total revenue of a company, 
minimal fuel burn for a car or total production of a factory. 

RL may be considered a naive subfield of Optimal Control. 
However, RL algorithms find policy (controller) by error minimization of objective from experience, 
while Optimal Control methods are concerned exact analytical optimal solutions based on dynamic model of the environment and the agent. 

Optimal Control methods are efficient and robust when mathematical model of environment is available, 
accurate enough and solvable for optimal controller in practice. 
However, many real world problems usually do not exhibit all of these conditions. 
In such cases, Reinforcement Learning is an easier alternative to derive a control policy.
