\chapter{NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING}
\label{chap:dnns}

Through increasing computing power ability of computers, deep neural networks dominated machine learning because much more data can be handled in this way. As a subfield of machine learning, the term deep learning emerged which is machine learning using deep neural networks. The recent success in computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning etc. was possible thanks to deep neural networks. \\
Despite of tons of variants, a neural network is defined as parametrized function approximator which is inspried by biological neurons. The first models of neural network developed by a neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and a mathematician Walter Pitts in 1943 \cite{mcculloch_logical_1943}. However, the idea of neural network known today arised after development of a simple binary classifier called perceptron invented by Rosenblast et al. \cite{rosenblatt_perceptron_1958}. It is a learning framework inspired by human brain. Although there are many types of neural networks, they are commonly based on linear transformations and nonlinear activations.\\
Neural networks can approximate any nonlinear function if designed as complex as required. Parameters are updated by backpropagation algorithm to minimize loss between its outputs and desired outputs.
