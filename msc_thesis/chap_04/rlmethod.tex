\section{RL Method and hyperparameters}
\label{sec:rlmethod}

TD3 is used as RL algorithm. 
Hyperparameters are selected by grid search and best performing values are used. Adam optimizer is used as optimizer. 

As exploration noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise is used and standart deviation is multiplied  by $0.999$ at the end of each episode. 
Initially $\theta=4.0$ and $\sigma=1.0$ are used. Other hyperparameters are as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\alpha=7.0 \cdot 10^{-4}$ (For LSTM)
	\item $\alpha=1.0 \cdot 10^{-3}$ (For Other networks)
	\item $\beta_1=0.9$
	\item $\beta_2=0.999$
	\item $\gamma=0.98$
	\item $N_{replay} = 500000$
	\item $N = 128$
\end{itemize}
