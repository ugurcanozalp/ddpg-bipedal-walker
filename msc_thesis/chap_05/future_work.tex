\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

There are few possible ways to improve upon this work. First of all, longer observation history can be used to handle partial observability for LSTM and Transformer models. However, this makes learning slower and difficult and requires stable RL algorithms. Secondly, different exploration strategies might be followed. Especially parameter space exploration \cite{plappert_parameter_2018} may perform better since it works better for environments with sparse reward like our environment. 
In addition, another RL algorithms might be applied. 
Lastly, better neural networks can be constructed by trial-error methods.
