\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

There might be a few possible ways to improve this work. 
First of all, longer observation history can be used to handle partial observability for LSTM and Transformer models. 
However, this makes learning slower and difficult and requires more stable RL algorithms and fine tuning on hyperparameters. 
Secondly, different exploration strategies might be followed. 
Especially parameter space exploration \cite{plappert_parameter_2018} may perform better since it works better for environments with sparse reward like our environment. 
Lastly, better neural networks as well as other state-of-the-art RL algoritmhs can be applied.
