\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, bipedal robot walking is investigated by deep  reinforcement learning methods. 

Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) 

As stated in previous chapters, most of the real world environments are partially observable. In Bipedal-Walker-Hardcore, the environment is also partially observable since agent cannot observe behind of it lacks of acceleration sensors which is better to have for controlling mechanical systems. Therefore, we used Long Short Term Memory and Transformer Neural Networks to capture more information from past observations compared to single instant observation. Along with them, we also implemented Residually connected Feed Forward Neural Network using single instant observation. \\

We were expecting to have better results with xxyy.
